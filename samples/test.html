                           <strong>Critical note:</strong>
                           <p>The alternative titles MacGreevy experimented with provide the key to this very
                  short poem. By the autumn of 1922 over six years had passed since Patrick Pearse
                  had proclaimed the Irish Republic in Dublin's General Post Office. The country had
                  seen the heart of its capital destroyed by the fires of Easter 1916, and this was
                  followed after the Seinn Fein victory in the 1918 election by an extended campaign
                  of guerilla warfare against the British with its reprisals and
                  counter-reprisals.</p>
                           <p>In the end, nationalist Ireland was divided into bitterly opposing camps, and
                  engaged in civil war over the terms of the agreement reached in London in December
                  1921. The new national institutions that emerged did so more through the passage
                  of time than as the expression of any national ideal or vision. MacGreevy's poem
                  captures the despair and weariness of a nation torn apart by war and bitter
                  political divisions.</p>

                                    The fifth of six allegorical triumphs in Petrarch's Trionfi is the Triumph of Time. Petrarch's Triumphs, often
                        depicted as Father Time in his chariot surrounded by symbolic devices such
                        as the scythe and hourglass, were frequently represented by Baroque and
                        Renaissance artists. MacGreevy, however, may be thinking of one or more of
                        the paintings that he saw during his visit to the Prado in Madrid in 1924.
                        One is Goya's Saturn [Time] Devouring His Son, and the other is Pieter
                        Brueghel the Elder's The Triumph of Death, which depicts a whole society
                        visited by death riding a pale horse (using imagery from the Apocalypse)
                        against a background of barren landscape and a darkened sky.

                  had proclaimed the Irish Republic in Dublin's General Post Office. The country had
                  seen the heart of its capital destroyed by the fires of Easter 1916, and this was
                  followed after the Seinn Fein victory in the 1918 election by an extended campaign
                  of guerilla warfare against the British with its reprisals and
                  counter-reprisals.</p>
                           <p>In the end, nationalist Ireland was divided into bitterly opposing camps, and
                  engaged in civil war over the terms of the agreement reached in London in December
                  1921. The new national institutions that emerged did so more through the passage
                  of time than as the expression of any national ideal or vision. MacGreevy's poem
                  captures the despair and weariness of a nation torn apart by war and bitter
                  political divisions.</p>

                  of time than as the expression of any national ideal or vision. MacGreevy's poem

               <strong>Critical note:</strong>
               <p>The alternative titles MacGreevy experimented with provide the key to this very
                  short poem. By the autumn of 1922 over six years had passed since Patrick Pearse
                  had proclaimed the Irish Republic in Dublin's General Post Office. The country had
                  seen the heart of its capital destroyed by the fires of Easter 1916, and this was
                  followed after the Seinn Fein victory in the 1918 election by an extended campaign
                  of guerilla warfare against the British with its reprisals and
                  counter-reprisals.</p>
               <p>In the end, nationalist Ireland was divided into bitterly opposing camps, and
                  engaged in civil war over the terms of the agreement reached in London in December
                  1921. The new national institutions that emerged did so more through the passage
