By the autumn of 1922 over six years had passed since Patrick Pearse had proclaimed the Irish Republic in Dublin's General Post Office. The country had seen the heart of its capital destroyed by the fires of Easter 1916, and this was followed after the Seinn Fein victory in the 1918 election by an extended campaign of guerilla warfare against the British with its reprisals and counter-reprisals.</span> <span class="p">In the end, nationalist Ireland was divided into bitterly opposing camps, and engaged in civil war over the terms of the agreement reached in London in December 1921. The new national institutions that emerged did so more through the passage of time than as the expression of any national ideal or vision. MacGreevy's poem captures the despair and weariness of a nation torn apart by war and bitter political divisions.</span>)</h1><div class="lg"><div class="l">The sun burns out, </div><div class="l">The world withers,<a class="notelink" href="#App2"><sup>2</sup></a></div><div class="l">Poets sing no more,<a class="notelink" href="#App3"><sup>3</sup></a></div><div class="l">And time grows afraid of the

                           hourglass, were frequently represented by Baroque and Renaissance
